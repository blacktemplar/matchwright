# Changelog

What changed for those running competitions with Matchwright, and for the data
they saved. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com),
and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

From 0.1.0 on, competitions saved by an earlier version keep opening in every
later one: the tags in a saved log (`tournament_engine::...`) never change, and
a file whose `"format"` changes is migrated, not refused.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-28

The first release, hosted at <https://blacktemplar.github.io/matchwright/>.

### Added

- Formats: round robin, random rounds of a round robin, single elimination
  (with an optional match for third place), double elimination (with an
  optional grand final reset) and Monster DYP.
- Rankings by criteria chosen and ordered per phase: points, wins, draws,
  losses, matches played, Buchholz, Buchholz of Buchholz, Sonneborn-Berger, and
  for knockouts the round of elimination or of the first loss.
- Results reported by tap, in the bracket, or typed (`3 1`, `ali`); every
  result and every action of a session can be undone and redone.
- Standings, a bracket and a cross table, for phones, tablets and laptops, in
  light or dark; English and German; WCAG 2.1 AA.
- Offline and installable; competitions stored in the browser, one tab changing
  a competition at a time; export and import as a file (format 1), which the
  command line (`tournament-cli`, also in the browser as `tournament-web`)
  opens and saves as well.
- A help page, which says that nothing entered leaves the device and that there
  is no tracking, that GitHub Pages, which serves the page, sees the IP address,
  and who the media owner is (§ 25 MedienG).
